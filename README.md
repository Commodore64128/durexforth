# durexforth

Modern, lean C64 Forth inspired by colorForth, JONESFORTH and Blazin' Forth. Project includes a vi clone written in Forth, a high-resolution graphics library, plus MML music support (new in 1.3!).

Goals:

* Fun. The system should be nice to work with on the real machine. Mixing Forth code with assembly is easy.
* Simplicity. The core should be small, leaving a lot of space for user code and data.
* Speed. Starting with v1.4, durexForth is subroutine threaded. This makes it a lot faster than any conventional 6502 Forth, including Blazin' Forth.
