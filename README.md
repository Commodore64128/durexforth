# durexforth

Modern C64 Forth. Includes a vi clone written in Forth, a high-resolution graphics library, plus MML music support.

Goals:

* Fun. The system should be nice to work with on the real machine.
* Fast. DurexForth is the <a href=https://theultimatebenchmark.org/>fastest</a> C64 Forth, generating code that runs at ~50x the speed of Basic V2!
* Easy to use. Implements the <a href=http://forth-standard.org/standard/words>Forth 2012</a> core standard.
