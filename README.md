# durexforth

Modern C64 Forth. Project includes a vi clone written in Forth, a high-resolution graphics library, plus MML music support (new in 1.3!).

Goals:

* Fun. The system should be nice to work with on the real machine.
* Speed. DurexForth compiles to machine code and is the fastest C64 Forth.
* Portability. Current aim is to implement all Forth 200x core words. (Not there yet!)
